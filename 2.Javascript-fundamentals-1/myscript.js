// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins the a trophy!

// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score).

// 3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰
// 4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

// TEST DATA: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110

// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, 
// it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

// 1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use
// an if/else statement (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). 
// Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'

// TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

// HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
// HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 

let bill = 430
let tip = (bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.20)
console.log(`the bill is ${bill}, tip is ${tip} and total bill + tip is ${bill + tip}`)
